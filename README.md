### Hey there.

Some code i enjoyed writing:

- Redux [filtering abstractions](https://github.com/rtviii/ribosome.xyz-frontend.ts/blob/master/src/redux/reducers/Filters/ActionTypes.ts) for a ribosomal protein database.
- [Simulation](https://github.com/rtviii/polygenicity-simulations/blob/master/february/Individual/Individ_T.py) of an evolving polygenic population.
- Neo4j's Cypher [Ribsomal Structure schema](https://github.com/rtviii/ribxz/blob/master/src/resources/cypher-tools/induct_struct..sh).

I am amateur at but seeking out experiences in:
+ smart contract/blockchain programming
+ systems/infrastracture
+ numerical/embedded programming
+ data science
+ formal verification/binary analysis
