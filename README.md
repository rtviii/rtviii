### Hey there.

#### Some code i enjoyed writing:

  - Redux [filtering abstractions](https://github.com/rtviii/ribosome.xyz-frontend.ts/blob/master/src/redux/reducers/Filters/ActionTypes.ts) for a ribosomal protein [database](https://ribosome.xyz). __TS__ 
  - [Simulation](https://github.com/rtviii/polygenicity-simulations/blob/master/february/Individual/Individ_T.py) of an evolving polygenic population. __Python 3__
  - Neo4j's Cypher [Ribsomal Structure schema](https://github.com/rtviii/ribxz/blob/master/src/resources/cypher-tools/induct_struct..sh). __Cypher__(SQL for graphs)

I am amateur at but seeking out experiences in:

+ smart contract/blockchain programming
+ systems/infrastracture
+ numerical/embedded programming
+ data science, vision, modelling, comp. bio
+ formal verification/binary analysis
